This project is a guided project by [DataQuest](https://app.dataquest.io/c/112/m/350/guided-project%3A-profitable-app-profiles-for-the-app-store-and-google-play-markets/1/analyzing-mobile-app-data) which helps in performing practical data analysis. 

In the project, I am a data analyst that works for a company which builds free Android and iOS apps. To make revenue, we use in-app ads. Thus i need to analyse data to help our developers know which app profiles are profitable.
